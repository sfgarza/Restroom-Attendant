# Restroom Attendant pi-bot.
 
This bot is designed to keep track of the current status of the restroom and to notify the proper channels when the status changes. I use passive infrared sensors to detect motion since they are cheap and easy to use, they're also less creepy than a camera.
 
__NOTE:__ Most PIR sensors have a couple of knobs that allow you to adjust the sensitivity and time-delay. These settings may vary depending on your environment.

### TODO:
 - Elaborate setup instructions.
 - Swap to pi zero instead of pi 3.
 - Design inconspicuous project housing.
